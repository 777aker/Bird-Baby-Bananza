Totally not done but I don't have anymore time so turning in an unfinished product
You can right click on the top of the big buildings to make the circle activate above them
You can left click in zones to spawn buildings that will spawn units
Not really any winning or losing currently
It's built so it's really easy to expand so it wouldn't be that hard to add stuff
I just don't have the time
IE birds is a class that can inherit and be copied easily, so are buildings, and units
The way birds are created is from a list so you can just add your new ones to the list
And then there is actually a gameover and gamewin conditions, with a score
variable saved and updated, and methods called, but they just don't do anything

Design:
- Central place where your birds come from
- Birds randomly given to you
- When you click, the current bird goes to where
you clicked and drops building
- Building spawns units
- Units kill units and buildings
- If 1 HQ is destroyed you lose
- If you activate all 5 HQs game ends
process
- When a baby enters an area the population increases
- Mobs spawn in that area depending on population
- The areas have different mobs that fight
- If you don't deliver them a baby they fight you
- When everyone else is dead they fight you
